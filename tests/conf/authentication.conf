# Password policy
# ---------------------------------------------------
#
# Password complexity may be enforced with the following rules:
#
# min_length = length                [Minimum number of characters the password must contain.]
# max_length = length                [Maximum number of characters the password must contain.]
# upper_case = count                 [Minimum number of upper case characters the password must contain.]
# lower_case = count                 [Minimum number of lower case characters the password must contain.]
# digits = count                     [Minimum number of numeric characters the password must contain.]
# special_characters = count         [Minimum number of special characters the password must contain.]
# does_not_contain => [phrase list]  [Phrases that the password should not contain.]
#
# You can specify any number of policies. Policies with a single rule (Eg. the "length_policy" below)
# enforce a single criterion. Policies with multiple rules (Eg. the "content_policy" below) will validate
# if the number of passing rules within the policy is greater than or equal to the policy's min_passing_rules
# setting. If min_passing_rules is omitted a value of 1 is assumed.
