# ID numbering config (for MultipartIDNumber ID numbering plug-in)
#
#
# ID numbers are the identifying numbers you provide for certain types of data 
# items in your CollectiveAccess database. They are stored as simple strings and reflect
# what *you* refer to the item by. They should be unique but don't have to be. They may contain non-numeric characters.
# They may have a regular format or they may vary widely from item to item. Numbering systems for existing collections almost 
# always have inconsistencies and irregularities and CollectiveAccess can accomodate them. 
#
# Note that ID numbers are *not* the row_id's automatically assigned to data items
# by CollectiveAccess. row_id's are guaranteed to be unique, are always simple integers 
# and cannot be changed once assigned. CollectiveAccess uses row_id's internally to unambiguously 
# refer to data items. You do not have to worry about CollectiveAccess mixing up items with the same ID number
# because CollectiveAccess never uses ID numbers for its internal operations. 
#
# By contrast ID numbers allow CollectiveAccess users to refer to data items using familiar (and perhaps 
# arbitrary) identifers and to cross-reference CollectiveAccess-hosted data with data from other sources that use the
# same ID numbering system. They can be in any format, from simply integers to arbitrarily formatted alphanumeric 
# strings of text.
#
# Since ID numbers are stored as strings any input format is considered valid. While this is acceptable for many
# uses, often it is desirable to enforce standards for data entry and/or provide a more structured data entry interface -
# perhaps one with drop-down menus for certain values or separate fields for different parts of the number.
#
# CollectiveAccess provides a plug-in framework for implementing ID number entry interfaces and validation of input.
# By developing your own plug-in, you can implement any behaviors you need. For instance, one could develop a plug-in 
# that uses an external system to generate new object accession numbers. Most implementors will never have to deal with 
# plug-ins, however. CollectiveAccess ships with a general-purpose "MultipartIDNumber" plugin which should be suitable 
# for the vast majority of users. This configuration file sets the parameters for the MultipartIDNumber plug-in.
#
# The MultiPartIDNumber plug-in models an ID number as a collection of "elements" joined together by a 
# "separator." Each element has a type and various parameters that determine what is valid for the element and how it 
# behaves in the user interface. For a complete description of the parameters see http://wiki.collectiveaccess.org/index.php?title=Multipart_ID_Numbers
#
# CollectiveAccess supports ID numbers for the following data items:
#
# - objects ("ca_objects")
# - object lots ("ca_object_lots")
# - entity authority ("ca_entities")
# - place names authority ("ca_places")
# - collection authority items ("ca_collections")
# - items in user-defined authorities (aka "occurrences") ("ca_occurrences")
#
# You can specify different numbering systems for different types of a given data item. So, for example, you can
# have different numbering schemes for "video" objects than "book" objects. When specifying a format for a specific type
# use the 'idno' value for the type as entered in its ca_list_items entry. This corresponds to the left-hand side identifier
# for the type in the installation profile you used to configure your system.
#
# Each data item also has a default numbering format used for all types for which a format has not been specified. 
# At a minimum you must define a default format for each type of data item.
# 
# Each format is used to generate user interface and validate input for the 'idno' field
# of the respective data item. For objects, this is the 'idno' field; for lots this is the 
# 'idno_stub' field; for the various authorities it is the 'idno' field.
# 
# Options to require ID numbers for the various data items to be unique and/or valid are set in the application
# configuration (app.conf) file.
