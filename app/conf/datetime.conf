# Output options for date/times
#

# Format to use for dates; valid values are (text|delimited|iso8601|yearOnly|ymd|original)	[default is text]
# "original" is the date as entered by the user; other values will normalize all date/time input
# to the selected standard format:
#	ymd =  year-month-day format (Ex. 1927/10/07)
#	delimited = delimited date format (Ex. 10/7/1927)
# 	iso8601 = ISO date format (Ex. 1927/10/07); iso8601 and ymd are similar in format, but ymd respects all formatting options (Eg. custom delimiters)
#	yearOnly = year display only, discarding month, day and time if present
