# Embedded media metadata extraction config
#
#
# CollectiveAccess can extract metadata such as titles, descriptions, dates, georeferences and technical information
# embedded in uploaded media and automatically add it to catalogue records, streamlining workflow.
# Catalogue data can also be embedded into media as they are downloaded from CollectiveAccess. This can be useful if you want
# metadata to "travel" with a downloaded file.
#
# CollectiveAccess supports inserting of extracted metadata into the following catalogue items:
#
# - objects ("ca_objects")
# - object representations ("ca_object_representations")
#
# CollectiveAccess can embed as XMP metadata into media catalogue data from any item related to the media's ca_object_representations record.
# Relationships may be specified as relative to the ca_object_representations record or a ca_objects record.
# NOTE: *only* XMP fields are supported for embedding. See http://wiki.collectiveaccess.org/index.php?title=Media_Metadata for a list.
#
# This configuration file allows you to define how metadata is extracted and inserted into the catalogue ("import" mappings), and how
# metadata is embedded into media downloaded from CollectiveAccess ("export" mappings). You can specify different 
# import and export mappings for different types of a catalogue item. For example, you could have a mapping for "video" 
# objects, another for "photograph" objects and a third for everything else. 
#
# Each catalogue item may have a default mapping used for all types for which a mapping has not been otherwise specified. 
# If you don't specify at least one mapping applicable to a catalogue item type, either type-specific or default,  
# processing will not be performed.

# Mappings used when inserting extracted embedded metadata into a catalogue item
#
# For a given type, they keys are embedded metadata fields, and the values are an associative list of metadata element codes, intrinsic field values, preferred_labels or nonpreferred_labels
# The specifier for embedded metadata fields are formed by concatenating the metadata system (ex. "EXIF", "IPTC", "XMP"), any sub-categories and the field name using colons (":"). 
# For systems such as XMP, simply add the field name onto "XMP:" (ex. "XMP:Description"). For EXIF, which uses nested sub-categories, specifier can be more complex. For
# example: EXIF:IFD0:Model would represent the model of camera used to create the image.
