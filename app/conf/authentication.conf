# ---------------------------------------------------
# Available options are:
#	CaUsers : Database-powered authentication with secure password hashing. No additional setup required.
#	OpenLDAP : Authentication via OpenLDAP/slapd-based directory service
#	ActiveDirectory : Authentication via Microsoft Active Directory service
#	ExternalDB : Authentication using an external database
#   Shibboleth: Authentication via the Shibboleth SSO service
#   Okta: Authentication via the Okta SSO service

# Optional fallback to authenticate against local ca_users user database if login with chosen 
# authentication adapter fails. This can be handy when you have existing locally managed CA users alongside
# an organizational directory... or it can be a security hole if you don't. Leave disabled unless actually needed.
allow_fallback_to_ca_users_auth = 0

# Optional regular expressions to rewrite user name with when authenticating. Authentication will be performed using
# the transformed user name. This can be helpful when the underlying authentication system expects user names in 
# a different format than expected by users (Eg. users use email addresses as user name but auth system expects 
# bare user names). "rewrite_username_with_regex" is used for matching; "rewrite_username_to_regex" is used for substitutions.

# ---------------------------------------------------
# Password policy
# ---------------------------------------------------
#
# Password complexity may be enforced with the following rules:
#
# min_length = length                [Minimum number of characters the password must contain.]
# max_length = length                [Maximum number of characters the password must contain.]
# upper_case = count                 [Minimum number of upper case characters the password must contain.]
# lower_case = count                 [Minimum number of lower case characters the password must contain.]
# digits = count                     [Minimum number of numeric characters the password must contain.]
# special_characters = count         [Minimum number of special characters the password must contain.]
# does_not_contain => [phrase list]  [Phrases that the password should not contain.]
#
# You can specify any number of policies. Policies with a single rule (Eg. the "length_policy" below)
# enforce a single criterion. Policies with multiple rules (Eg. the "content_policy" below) will validate
# if the number of passing rules within the policy is greater than or equal to the policy's min_passing_rules
# setting. If min_passing_rules is omitted a value of 1 is assumed.
