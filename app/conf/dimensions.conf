# Eg. "2 1/2 in x 5 in x 10 in" is output as "2 1/2 x 5 x 10 in"
#

# -------------------------
# Display dimension units
# -------------------------
# You can override the standard display dimensions ("in", "ft", "cm", "m", etc.)
# here by defining by setting the standard code for the dimension to its alternate. 
# To set meters to display as the word "meters" rather than the standard "m" set this below:
#
#		m = meters
display_units = {
#	in = inches
}
