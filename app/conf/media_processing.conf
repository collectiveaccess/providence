# If you want original media fetched from URLs to *NOT* be stored in CA, but rather
# for CA to directly reference the media via the URL used to fetch it set use_external_url_when_available to 1
# 
# If you have no idea what this means then leave this set to zero
#
use_external_url_when_available = 0

#
# Filesize (in bytes) above which media should be queued for background processing
# Files smaller than the threshold will be processed at the time of upload, so you should set this to a 
# small enough value that your server has a shot at processing the media in near-realtime. A safe bet is
# 500,000 bytes (eg. 0.5 megabytes), but you may need to go lower (or higher). 
#
# Note that you can override this setting for specific media types and versions below if you wish. Also keep in
# mind a few other fun facts:
#
#	1. If the queue_enabled setting in global.conf is set to zero then no background processing will take place, no matter what you set here.
#	2. The default setting for queue_enabled is zero, so make sure you change it if you want background processing to happen.
#	3. Versions that have no QUEUE_WHEN_FILE_LARGER_THAN are never queued for background processing; versions with a QUEUE_WHEN_FILE_LARGER_THAN settings of zero are similarly never queued (absence and zero are one and the same, config-wise).
#	4. Some types of media are setup by default to never queue no matter the "queue_threshold_in_bytes" and "queue_enabled" settings. This includes media types for much little or no processing is done, including SWF, XML and MSWord.
