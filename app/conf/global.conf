# ** The app_name is used to name the session cookie CollectiveAccess issues
# to users upon login. If you use characters not allowed in cookie names (spaces for instance)
# you will almost certainly run into problems with logins and session management. Be sure to keep
# your app_name to letters, numbers and underscores only.
