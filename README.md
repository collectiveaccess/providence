Providence is the “back-end” cataloging component of CollectiveAccess, a web-based suite of applications providing a framework for management, description, and discovery of complex digital and physical collections.  Providence is highly configurable and supports a variety of metadata standards, data types, and media formats.  

CollectiveAccess is a collaboration between Whirl-i-Gig and partner institutions in North America and Europe with projects in 5 continents. The software is freely available under the open source GNU Public License, meaning it’s not only free to download and use but that users are encouraged to share and distribute code.
